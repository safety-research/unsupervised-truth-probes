Being \"Qualified\" on a government test doesn't mean your going to be a good driver at all. Its all about generating revenue. I agree people should take classes and have training for firearms. But being legally required to register all guns does nothing to help prevent gun crimes the statistics are there, What reason does it matter to anyone if i own guns, I'm not harming a single person with them. Non of them have killed anyone on their own (Safely locked away when not in use) Licensing is the government selling your RIGHT back to you. I highly suggest getting training. But being legally required to pay for government classes and having to register your weapons does nothing to curb gun violence.

Replace comprehensive insurance for everyone with catastrophic insurance and a health savings account (it would have worked better with an additional health line of credit), adding market mechanisms to health purchases.  Of course, the line of credit would end the need to shop around and show that health care is not a normal good - use is not tied to market competition - you get it and worry about paying for it later.
